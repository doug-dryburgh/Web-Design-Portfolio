                        <p>A fledging front-end developer. I am currently in the process of studying to be a full stack developer.</p>
                        <p>I have had a longstanding interest in web development, having built my first webpage at the age of 11. I am now focused to look beyond templates and software to learn and write code from scratch.</p>
                        <p>I have a lot of passion for creative projects. I've freelanced in photography for over 8 years. Web design is yet another creative outlet.</p>

                                <h3>Pura Vida Photography</h3>
                                <p>I have been passionate about photography for nearly a decade. In this time I have learned myself or from those around me while taking on freelance jobs. I designed and built this website to showcase my favourite work.</p>
                                <p>With this design I utilized css transitions to make a pleasing slideshow on the homepage. In addition I modified and implimented the blueimp gallery plugin for my galleries as well as used basic javascript to animate a slide-out menu. The website is fully responsive to look good on all platforms.</p>

                                <h3>Mad Minute</h3>
                                <p>The inspiration for this project came from a primary school exercise I used to have to do. The teacher would give us a sheet of math problems and we would have to complete as many as possible in one minute. I've recreated this exercise in a web app. The program will randomly generate a series of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division problems.</p>

                                <p>This was a self assigned project. The goal was to continue working on projects I enjoy, specifically interactive apps, while also creating something that could be educational. I made more use of CSS flexbox. This project required me to validate the user's input to determine if it was a correct word. I sourced a wordlist, and created a function to accomplish this.</p>

                                <p>This assignment required building a Simon style memory game. There were many requirements including two different modes and adding simple audio. I learned about and used CSS flexbox for the first time and found it a very useful tool. In addition I found and utilized an addon that allows for colour animation through the jQuery animate method.</p>

                                <p>This fun project required building a Tic Tac Toe game. I'm proud of the design and feel of the game but the real challenge was to design the computer's AI. I started first with a 'noob' mode in which the computer chooses at random. Once I understood this process I then implemented a 'medium' mode in which the computer uses far greater logic to try and best the player.</p>

                                <p>In this FCC project I designed a countdown timer. The features allow you to choose a task length between 1-90 minutes, with a break interval of 1-30 minutes. The app will display the remaining time in the session/break. A progress bar also displays the percentage of the session left. Alongside this I added some basic animation to make the app look sleek.</p>

                                <p>This app allows the user to complete basic arithmetic functions. It allows addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Features include being able to chain multiple operations and use a decimal place. (There is a known issue with floating point arithmetic which will be corrected.</p>

                                <p>This site was a project I completed through my studies on Free Code Camp. The objective was to utilize the open weather map api in order to show the current weather in the user's current location. I customized the design with custom background which illistrate the weather conditions.</p>

                                <p>In this Free Code Camp assisgnment I built a page utilizing the MediaWiki api. The requirements included being able to search for any topic, and return the results from Wikipedia. In addition the user was to be able to click a button to see a random article. I customized this page further with some astecially pleasing css animations.</p>

                                <p>This Free Code Camp assignment was an introduction to using an api. I utilized the forismatic api in order to show a random inspiring quote. An additional requirement was to provide the functionality for the user to tweet that quote from the page. I used css gradients to further set a positive tone to the page.</p>
